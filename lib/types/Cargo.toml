### Note: This sub-crate is not allowed to have dependencies to other Jotoba crates, unless its only used if `jotoba_intern` is enabled.

[features]
# This feature adds stuff required for Jotoba to work but not necessarily for extern crates, so its made optional
jotoba_intern = ["localization","api" ]

# Contains raw types of JMdict, KanjiDict, ... which are only required to parse but not directly used by Jotoba
raw_types = []

# Contains API types, and can be used as rust wrapper around the Jotoba API
api = []
